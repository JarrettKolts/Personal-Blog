# Personal-Blog

## Description

- I created this website as a two page website. One page creates a blog and adds it to the blogsite. The add post button takes you to the blog site. I also implemented a daark mode, and a delete button to the added posts. I made this website because I wanted to create a way to express emotions, ideas, stories, etc.
- This works by using two HTML files that are linked to each other using an href and the javascript works behind the scenes to add the blog to the blogsite.
